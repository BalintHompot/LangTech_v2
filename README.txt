README:
This program works by moving to the project directory and running
"python3 main.py.

In the program, you have 2 options: either you run from the commandline,
where you type in each question, or you run
type 1, which opens a file picker window, where you select the file that contains the questions.

The code removes the first three characters. The input format was not clear as the slides mentioned 2 
unnecessary characters (id and tab) but the example contained 3 (a space before the ID).
We decided to go along with the test question format.

It is necessary to install some modules. This can be done with pip3, or
inside the PyCharm IDE. These modules are:
requests, sys, spacy, nltk, termcolor and word2number.
